This complete implementation includes:

1. Comprehensive UI Framework with:
   - Multiple screens (main and graph views)
   - Various widgets (Button, Label, FloatDisplay, BatteryWidget, FunctionPlotter)
   - IR remote control support
   - Screen switching capabilities

2. Advanced Charging Features:
   - Multiple termination methods (-dV detection, temperature delta)
   - Temperature monitoring (both battery and ambient)
   - Charge current control with PWM
   - Capacity tracking
   - Different charging states (Fast, Trickle, Complete)

3. Data Visualization:
   - Real-time battery status display
   - Multiple graph views (voltage, current, temperature delta)
   - Historical data tracking
   - Easy switching between different graph types

4. Safety Features:
   - Temperature monitoring and protection
   - Delta temperature (dT/dt) protection
   - Voltage monitoring
   - Current limiting
   - Error state handling

The code is organized in a modular way that allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements. Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?
