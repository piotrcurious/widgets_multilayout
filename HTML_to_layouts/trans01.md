To create an HTML transpiler that generates Arduino code based on the layout defined in HTML pages, we can break the task into several key steps:

Step 1: Parsing the HTML Layout

We'll extract layout information and widget specifications from the HTML. The layout will typically include the widget's position, dimensions, and associated callbacks (via hyperlinks). This will require using an HTML parsing library like BeautifulSoup in Python.

Step 2: Mapping HTML Elements to Widgets

Each HTML element (like images) will map to a specific widget type (e.g., text widget, graph widget). We will need to define how different HTML attributes (like id, class, or data-* attributes) translate to widget properties such as position, size, and data source functions.

Step 3: Extracting Callback Logic

The hyperlinked text sections of the HTML will define the callback functions for each widget. We'll extract these functions and associate them with the corresponding widgets during transpilation.

Step 4: Code Generation

Finally, based on the parsed HTML, we'll generate Arduino code for the widgets, including layout management, display updates, and callback logic. We'll ensure the code follows the same structure as your existing system, using classes, widget management, and dynamic layout switching.

Let's start with Step 1: Parsing the HTML Layout

In Python, we can use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract key elements like images and hyperlinks. Here's a basic structure for this step:

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Sample HTML input (can be read from a file)
html = """
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="layout1">
      <img src="widget1.png" style="left:10px; top:10px; width:100px; height:30px;" href="#callback1">
      <img src="widget2.png" style="left:10px; top:50px; width:100px; height:30px;" href="#callback2">
    </div>
    <div id="layout2">
      <img src="widget3.png" style="left:10px; top:90px; width:100px; height:30px;" href="#callback3">
    </div>
    <div id="callbacks">
      <section id="callback1">float getWatts() { return watts; }</section>
      <section id="callback2">float getVolts() { return volts; }</section>
      <section id="callback3">float getAmperes() { return amperes; }</section>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
"""

# Parse the HTML
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

# Find all images (widgets) in the layout
layout_widgets = soup.find_all('img')

for widget in layout_widgets:
    # Extract position and size from the style attribute
    style = widget['style']
    href = widget.get('href')  # Associated callback
    print(f"Widget found: {widget['src']}, Style: {style}, Callback: {href}")

This code parses the HTML and extracts key attributes (like src, style, and href) that define widgets. Next, we will map these to Arduino widget code.

Step 2 will involve translating these attributes into a corresponding widget class in the Arduino code. Once you are ready, we can proceed with that.
