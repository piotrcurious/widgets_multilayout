 Understood. You're looking for an existing visual GUI designer that generates a simple format, making it easier to transpile into your custom Arduino code. Let's focus on a few options that might fit this criteria:

1. Glade (GTK+ User Interface Builder):



Glade generates XML files (.glade) which describe the UI layout. These files are relatively simple to parse and could be a good starting point for transpilation.

Pros:
- Generates clean, readable XML
- Supports a wide range of widgets
- Open-source and actively maintained

Cons:
- Designed for GTK+, so some widgets may not map directly to your system

2. Qt Designer:

Qt Designer produces .ui files, which are also XML-based. While Qt is more complex than Glade, its .ui files are still relatively straightforward.

Pros:
- Powerful and flexible
- XML-based output
- Widely used in industry

Cons:
- Some Qt-specific widgets may not translate well to your system

3. wxFormBuilder:

wxFormBuilder generates XML or XRC files, which are similar in structure to Glade's output.

Pros:
- Simple interface
- Generates clean XML
- Cross-platform

Cons:
- Less actively maintained than some alternatives

4. Kivy Designer:

While Kivy is primarily for Python, its Designer tool generates KV language files, which have a simple, indentation-based structure.

Pros:
- Simple, readable output format
- Designed with touch interfaces in mind (potentially good for embedded systems)

Cons:
- KV language is less common, might require more work to parse

5. Electron GUI Designer:

This tool generates JSON files describing the UI, which could be very easy to parse and transpile.

Pros:
- JSON output is very easy to parse
- Designed for cross-platform applications

Cons:
- Relatively new and less mature than other options

Given your requirements, I would recommend focusing on Glade or wxFormBuilder. Their XML outputs are simple enough to parse and transform, and they offer a good balance of features and simplicity.

Here's a basic example of what Glade's XML output looks like:

<antArtifact identifier="glade-xml-example" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="xml" title="Glade XML Output Example">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<interface>
  <requires lib="gtk+" version="3.20"/>
  <object class="GtkWindow" id="window1">
    <property name="can_focus">False</property>
    <child>
      <object class="GtkBox">
        <property name="visible">True</property>
        <property name="can_focus">False</property>
        <property name="orientation">vertical</property>
        <child>
          <object class="GtkLabel">
            <property name="visible">True</property>
            <property name="can_focus">False</property>
            <property name="label" translatable="yes">Watts</property>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
</interface>
</antArtifact>

This XML structure could be relatively easily parsed and transformed into your custom widget format. You would need to write a transpiler that maps Glade's widget types to your custom types, and transforms the properties into your widget constructor parameters.

Would you like me to elaborate on how you might approach writing a transpiler for Glade's XML output to your Arduino code format?
